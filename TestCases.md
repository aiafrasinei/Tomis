# Manual test cases

Edge cases , things to think about:

- No gates are places on the board
Possible to play i suppose.

- The players put only one gate on the board on back row and activates it

- The player puts all the gates but never activates them

- One player plays with gates the other dont

- Both players puts all gates, activates them but dont use jumpgates

- One player plays with gates/jumpgates the other dont

-
